# Character types

A *character type* is a family of characters which are indexed by a set of parameters,
together with ranges of admissible values for each parameters, and a set of
excluded parameter values. The characters in a character type share many properties,
e.g. they all have the same degree.

Since "types" already have a very specific meaning in Julia (and other programming
languages), we instead sometimes refer to character types as "generic characters".
In particular the Julia types we use to represent character types are called
`AbstractGenericCharacter`, `GenericCharacter` and `SimpleGenericCharacter`.

## Iteration

Character types behave in some ways similar to Julia `Vector` objects in that
one can index into them to extract values.
For a character type `ct`,
- `length(ct)` returns the number of values in the character type (which is equal to the number
   of class types s in the table),
- `ct[i]` returns the $i$th value of the character type,
- `ct[i:j]` returns the values $i$ to $j$,
- `ct[:]` returns all values.

The $i$th character type can be obtained from a generic character table `g`
in two ways: via `g[i]` or via `g[i,:]`. The following example demonstrates this.

```jldoctest
julia> g=generic_character_table("GL2");

julia> g[3,:]
Generic character of GL2
  with parameters
    k ∈ {1,…, q - 1}, l ∈ {1,…, q - 1} except -l + k ∈ (q - 1)ℤ
  of degree q + 1
  with values
    (q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
    E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
    E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)
    0

julia> ct = g[3]
Generic character of GL2
  with parameters
    k ∈ {1,…, q - 1}, l ∈ {1,…, q - 1} except -l + k ∈ (q - 1)ℤ
  of degree q + 1
  with values
    (q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
    E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
    E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)
    0

julia> ct[1]
(q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)

julia> ct[1:3]
3-element Vector{GenericCharacterTables.GenericCyclo}:
 (q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)

julia> ct[2:end]
3-element Vector{GenericCharacterTables.GenericCyclo}:
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)
 0

julia> collect(ct)
4-element Vector{GenericCharacterTables.GenericCyclo}:
 (q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)
 0

julia> ct[:]
4-element Vector{GenericCharacterTables.GenericCyclo}:
 (q + 1)*E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + i*k)
 E(q - 1)^(i*l + j*k) + E(q - 1)^(i*k + j*l)
 0

## Parameter names
When two characters types are for example added together or multiplied with each
other, it is necessary to differentiate the parameters of the two character
types. Otherwise the result will only represent a fraction of all possible
combinations of characters. Namely those where the parameters of the character
types with identical name have the same value. Therefore the parameter `k` will
be called `kti` whenever it represents the parameter `k` of the $i$-th character
type of a tensor product. Similarly it will be called `kli` in a linear
combination and `ki` in a scalar product.

Note that for linear combinations this has the possibly unexpected implication
that $2\chi$ represents the character type containing the double of each
character contained in $\chi$ while $\chi+\chi$ represents the character type
containing every possible sum of two characters in $\chi$.

## Constructing new character types

The immediate way to obtain a character type object is to get it from a 
table `T` via indexing, i.e., as `T[i]` for some index $i$.

In addition, there are a few ways to construct new character types.

```@docs
tensor_product(char1::GenericCharacter, char2::GenericCharacter)
tensor_product(char1::SimpleGenericCharacter{T}, char2::SimpleGenericCharacter{T}) where T <: PolyRingElem
linear_combination
omega
```

## Norms and scalar products

`GenericCharacterTables` allows you to compute norms and scalar products
of character types. The results are correct for all
possible combinations of parameters except possibly for those where the
additionally returned exceptions apply. Those consist of multivariate
polynomials with coefficients in a rational function field and are
satisfied if the evaluation of this polynomial is an integer.

```@docs
norm(char::GenericCharacter)
norm(char::SimpleGenericCharacter{T}) where T <: NfPoly
scalar_product(char1::GenericCharacter, char2::GenericCharacter)
scalar_product(char1::SimpleGenericCharacter{T}, char2::SimpleGenericCharacter{T}) where T <: NfPoly
```
