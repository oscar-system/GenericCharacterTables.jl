These describe the entries of generic character tables. Two generic cyclotomics are defined to be equal if their evaluations coincide for every tuple of integers. Where evaluation just means replacing the free variables by actual values which yields a cyclotomic number. Usually the first component of the tuples is restricted to the prime powers, sometimes just to the even prime powers or something similar. This depends on the specific character table. Of course only evaluations where the g_1ldotsg_r are not zeros are considered.","category":"page"},{"location":"cyclo/","page":"Generic cyclotomics","title":"Generic cyclotomics","text":"These numbers form a ring which will be called generic cyclotomic ring.
